The problem to be solved is real-time pose estimation and form analysis for fitness coaching using ARKit and computer vision.
The project requires assistance with ARKit body tracking and custom overlay rendering to provide real-time feedback on movement accuracy, 
as the creator lacks expertise in these specific areas of computer vision. 
The goal is to build an AI fitness coach that analyzes and improves users’ exercise form.


Based on the project structure and the problem I’m trying to solve — ARKit body tracking and custom overlay rendering for real-time fitness coaching — these are the key files I need to focus on modifying or debugging:

Critical Files to Focus On:

1.Set/AR/BodyMeshRenderer.swift

In BodyMeshRenderer.swift, I’ve implemented a more sophisticated and accurate mesh generation process to better 
represent the human body, replacing the overly simplistic fallback mesh. I optimized performance by updating the mesh instead 
of recreating it frequently and improved vertex and normal calculations. I also enhanced the visual feedback system by 
tying the heat map to specific body parts for precise form analysis and added error state handling to gracefully manage tracking loss.

2.Set/AR/FormAnalyzer.swift

I’ve introduced a modular configuration system that defines exercise-specific parameters in clean structs, 
making it easy to add new exercises without altering core logic. Phase detection is now more accurate, 
tracking eccentric and concentric movements to deliver phase-specific feedback. Scoring has become more granular, 
evaluating individual joints with a weighted system for different form aspects. Feedback is now more targeted, 
offering specific suggestions for joint adjustments along with phase-aware coaching tips. 
Tracking has been enhanced with improved rep counting tied to exercise phases and smoothed scoring using a 
moving average. The architecture is cleaner, with configuration separated from analysis logic, 
distinct methods for each analysis step, and stronger error handling. 
Finally, performance is optimized through joint position caching and more efficient angle calculations.

3.Set/AR/MirrorViewController.swift

I improved the system by adding a proper state machine with MirrorState and better error handling through MirrorError, ensuring the UI updates automatically when the state changes. Performance was optimized with frame skipping, proper AR session pause/resume handling, and Combine observers for app state changes. The UI code is now cleaner with extensions for styling, better organization of components, and a debug view toggle via double-tap. Architecturally, I separated AR, Vision, and UI concerns, improved memory management with Combine, and strengthened error handling. I also added a debug view for development, ensured smooth handling of background/foreground transitions, and implemented a cleaner gesture recognizer setup.

4.Set/AR/MirrorViewWrapper.swift

I enhanced the app by switching to @Binding for presentation state instead of relying on environment dismiss, and by using @State to track appearance state for better state management. 
I introduced a PerformanceMode enum to control processing rates, allowing configurable frame processing intervals for flexible performance tuning. Lifecycle handling was improved with proper background/foreground state management and resource cleanup before dismissal. Debugging is now cleaner and more configurable, with a clear separation of debug features. Architecturally, I separated configuration from implementation, extended MirrorViewController functionality, and used type-safe performance modes. SwiftUI integration is stronger with proper binding-based presentation, preview support, and a cleaner interface between SwiftUI and the UIKit view controller. Finally, I added safety features like thorough resource cleanup and proper session pausing/resuming to prevent leaks or performance issues.

5.Set/ViewModels/AICoachViewModel.swift

I improved state management by switching to @Binding for presentation control and tracking appearance with @State, added a PerformanceMode enum with configurable frame processing intervals for better performance, and implemented proper lifecycle handling to manage resources when the app moves between background and foreground. I also introduced a configurable debug mode with a clean separation of debug functionality, improved the architecture by separating configuration from implementation, added type-safe performance modes, and enhanced SwiftUI integration with proper bindings, preview support, and a cleaner interface to the UIKit controller. Finally, I ensured safety by cleaning up resources and correctly pausing or resuming sessions before dismissal.

6.Set/Views/VoiceAssistantOverlay.swift

I enhanced the system by integrating voice assistant feedback with ARKit form analysis, adding visual score displays with color coding, and prioritizing issue highlights. The interface is now context-aware, adapting actions, status text, and interactions based on exercise activity. Exercise-specific tips are presented in a tabbed interface with demo videos and auto-display when form deteriorates. Visual design improvements include smoother animations, clearer hierarchy, and better touch targets. AR integration ensures real-time reactions to pose analysis changes, delivering relevant feedback while maintaining seamless connection with the coaching view model.

7.Set/Models/Exercise.swift

I restructured the system by introducing a modular configuration setup where each exercise has its own clean configuration struct, 
making it easy for me to add new exercises without touching the core logic. I improved phase detection so it now accurately tracks 
exercise phases like eccentric and concentric, allowing me to give phase-specific feedback. I made the scoring more granular by 
evaluating individual joints and using a weighted scoring system for different aspects of form. 
I also enhanced the feedback mechanism so I can give targeted suggestions about which joints need adjustment and tailor tips based on the current phase of the movement. 
Tracking was refined with better rep counting tied to phases and smoothed scoring using a moving average. 
Architecturally, I separated configuration from analysis logic, created distinct methods for each analysis step, 
and improved error handling. Finally, I optimized performance by 
caching joint positions to avoid redundant lookups and making angle calculations more efficient.

Next Steps:

Test BodyMeshRenderer → Does the skeleton overlay appear correctly?

Debug FormAnalyzer → Are joint angles and positions being calculated accurately?

Check AICoachViewModel → Is my feedback logic triggering in sync with ARKit data?
